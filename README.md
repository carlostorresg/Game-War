# War Card Game

## Overview

This project is my first implementation of the classic card game "War" using object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. Two computer-controlled players compete to win all the cards.

## Features

OOP Design: Models the game with classes like Card, Deck, and Player.

Automated Gameplay: The game runs without user input.

Standard Card Deck: Uses a full deck of 52 cards.

War Scenarios: Handles ties with "war" logic.


## How to Play

The deck is shuffled and split between two players.
Each round, players draw cards, and the higher card wins the round.
In a tie, additional cards are drawn to determine the winner.
The game continues until one player wins all the cards.
